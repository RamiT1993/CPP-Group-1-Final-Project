Program Description: <b>The role of this program is to play several different types of minigames, three to be exact. This game will 
be like visiting a carnival. The games in question are choose the correct word letter-by-letter or Hangman, 
guess the picture line-by-line or Pictionary, and lastly play a board game where you advance spaces by 
rolling dice. The player can enter a choice ranging from numbers one to three to pick a game and if they 
do not choose one or inputted something by mistake a game will automatically be chosen for them
through random number generation of the three games. The game will use the “Q” or “q” key to quit the 
game and update the text file. To output the result, “Score Board” will be displayed, and the results will be 
outputted into a text file. This will act as a save state so when you start the program again, you can keep
the number of times you won. Text file will contain the total results of each minigame and the total win of 
all minigames.<b> <br><br><br>
